# SKY-Labs

An experimental Book Management System where sky is, literally, the limit :D

The basic concept of this project is to create a book sharing environment,atleast among the people studying/working at a common workplace.
It's important because apart from the Institutes library, the students hold a huge amount of books as their personal possession. And if they are willing to share people must know about them...

An initiative by a small dead poet's society.
